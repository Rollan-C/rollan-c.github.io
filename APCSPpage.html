<h3>
Why I took APCSP
    </h3>
<p>
In the long run, I want to overall improve my skills and lifestyle to be more adaptive to the technology and media that surrounds us. I also want to use this class as an easy 5, which later makes me Valedictorian, which then makes my person seem more eligible to higher jobs and learning. In the short run, I just want to have fun with the tech only given through this class.
